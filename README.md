# rotor-bomb
Set of scripts to decode/encode well-know ciphers.

My goal is to learn Ruby language by creating script library useful for crypto-newbies.

At the moment I am also crypto-newbie(and Ruby too).

If u also like cryptoanalysis and have some programming background - feel free to fork and modify.
